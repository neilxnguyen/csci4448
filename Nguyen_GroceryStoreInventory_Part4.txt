Due Nov. 16th 11am

I had to redo my whole project because I wanted to use javafx to handle the operations
in the interface. I was previously using java and using the console as the controller.
I like having javafx GUI to handle most of the operations, as I can control what is
happening by allowing the User buttons and textboxes and such. I learned javafx through
youtube guides and a lot of google-fu, and I still have a lot to learn. I think using
javafx gives me a huge advantage, in being able to debug issues and ensure quality in
the product I am delivering. I hope this demonstration was satisfactory. I will be
working on it over Thanksgiving holiday.

I still have to implement Customer functionality such as the shopping cart, checking out,
and others. And I still have to add Admin functions such as the ability to add products,
delete produce, add to stock, etc.
